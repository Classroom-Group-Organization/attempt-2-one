### Rear Axel Mounting
The preparation to mount the rear axel was a large task in its own right. To fasten the two block axel mounts first required I carefully measure to ensure they were equally far apart from each edge of the chair, lest one side hold too much weight and turn in circles–or worse, collapse. Notice how I have not yet fully attached the rear axel – I will hold off on that until I mount the rear sprocket and wheels.
