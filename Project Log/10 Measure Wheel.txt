### Rear Wheel Mounting
Once the front wheels were mounted, it was time to move back to the rear. I used a welder to secure the wheels and rear sprocket to the axel, to ensure that when the motor turned the axel the wheels would move with it. I also ended up priming the finished rear axel with rubber paint to make its weight less harsh on the floor.
